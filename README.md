 Enhanced Vision
An adaptive AI trading system that starts simple, learns continuously from every trade, and evolves its strategies through reinforcement learning, pattern recognition, and extensive backtesting across multiple market regimes.
________________________________________
 Core Philosophy: Learn → Adapt → Evolve
Self-Learning Hierarchy:
1.	Pattern Learning - Identify what works in different market conditions
2.	Strategy Evolution - Modify existing strategies based on performance
3.	Market Regime Detection - Adapt behavior to trending vs ranging markets
4.	Risk Adaptation - Adjust position sizing based on recent performance
5.	Meta-Learning - Learn which learning approaches work best
